# Grid connected 40kW PV system design

This project shows how to design a 40kW PV system connected to a 400V grid.

Two major selections for "Gridtied.slx" model:

- Continuous powergui solver at 50Hz
- Jinko Solar Co_Ltd JKM245P-60 solar module


## Getting Started

To run this demo:
1. Load the DesignBoost in Matlab and run the script.
2. Load the LDesign in Matlab and run the script.
3. Load the MPPT in Matlab
4. Run the gridtied model in simulink


## Getting Started

To run this demo:
1. Load the and run model in simulink
2. Open the powergui block and select load flow analyser
3. Select update and then compute.
4. The load flow results are generated

## Toolbox Requirements
